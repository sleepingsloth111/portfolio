      <h2>· Background ·</h2>
      <p>
        As a group of computer science students at Brown University, we wanted
        to iteratively design for a startup to contribute to the CS community.
         We decided to design for a startup called Taro.
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="taro-mission.png" class="d-block w-50 align-items-center" alt="taro's mission statement" />

    <div class="row" id="sketching">
      <h2 class="text-center">· Sketching and Wireframing ·</h2>
      <p>
        To summarize above, Taro is a website designed to be a premium
        subscription/membership based platform for software engineers who want
        to further their career. The idea is that with a payment, Taro will
        give exclusive access to information about jobs and how to get a job
        ranging from Q&As with leads from top tech companies and creating
        optimized performance reviews. The idea is to focus on the networking
        and non-technical side of the job.
        <br /><br />
        After looking at the concept of the startup, we assumed that our users
        consist of (1) software engineers currently employed, (2)
        undergraduate students looking for internship or post-grad
        opportunities, (3) recruiters at different companies. Software
        engineers who are currently employed would be impacted by this website
        because then they are able to learn tips and tricks about how to do
        their job better. Additionally, if they want to pivot companies, this
        website would provide valuable information for that. Undergraduate
        students would benefit from this because they are jumping into a field
        without much prior experience and would benefit from learning how to
        work as a software engineer and more specifically, how to work as a
        software engineer for a top tech company. Lastly, recruiters would
        benefit from the website because they are able to find software
        engineers who are ambitious and very much either currently on the job
        hunt or looking to further their career by switching companies. Our
        users who would interact with their desktop.

        Scenario Summary: You are Jeff Huang, a college computer science
        professor, who is thinking of going back into the software engineering
        industry. You bought a subscription to Taro, an exclusive software
        engineering career resource and networking platform. Your task is to
        find the Expert Advice article on an Amazon Recruiter's take on the
        recession and job market. (Note: This is a prototype and not an actual
        website so interactions may feel quite different). <br /><br />
        We analyzed their performance and commentary for each subtask.
        <br /><br />
        Go to sign in and login (Assume that the username and password are
        prefilled):
        <ul>
          <li>
            All users were able to complete the task and all noted that it was
            an easy process
          </li>
          <li>
            A few users noted how intuitive the location of the sign in button
            was and that the change to the home page with a profile picture
            where the sign in button was confirmed that they have successfully
            signed in
          </li>
          <li>
            This was in line with our expectations as we modeled our sign in
            process and layout similar to other platforms
          </li>
        </ul>
        Navigate to the Expert Advice page:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 out of 3 users were able to navigate to the Expert Advice page
            by clicking on the Expert Advice button on the navigation bar
          </li>
          <li>
            One user directly went to the article from the home screen and was
            confused by the next subtask. He concluded that the login screen
            took him to the Expert Advice page as the back button was labeled
            so
          </li>
          <li>
            Though we expected for some users to directly go to the article,
            we did not expect his conclusion to be that the home screen to the
            Expert Advice page due to the back button in the article labeling
            back to Expert Advice
          </li>
        </ul>
        Go to the article titled "How to handle the recession from an Amazon
        recruiter's perspective”:
        <ul>
          <li>
            All users were able to go to the article and said that completing
            the task was very easy
          </li>
          <li>
            This was in line with our expectations as we explicitly stated the
            article title to look for
          </li>
        </ul>
        Sign out of your account:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 out of 3 users successfully were able to complete the task and
            mentioned that the location of the sign out button (in a drop down
            after clicking profile picture) was very intuitive and followed
            the structure that all web pages follow
          </li>
          <li>
            One user clicked too far in the subtask step and the figma screen
            ended, but verbally told us his plan which was correct
          </li>
          <li>
            One user mentioned that a confirmation page that the signout was
            successful would have been nice
          </li>
          <li>
            This was in line with our expectations as followed the traditional
            logout location that most web pages follow
          </li>
        </ul>
        Based on the users' feedback, having the back button label be
        different for the article based on whether they navigated to the
        article from the Home page or Expert Advice page would help their
        understanding on what page they previously were in. Additionally,
        adding a successful sign out page after signing out would help the
        users confirm that they indeed did sign out. We feel confident in
        keeping all other aspects the same and the testing results were
        successful overall.

      <h2 class="text-center">· Conclusion ·</h2>
      <p> We learned a lot about the iterative process of making an interaction prototype.
        For complete transparency, the user test results were from a second set of tests since
        our first one ended up quite badly due to misassumptions about the testing process and
        how intuitive the question flow and tasks would be for the users. Thus, we edited the tasks
        to be much more explicit and learned how much the testing format and wording affect the user's
        interaction. It was also nice to feel like we contributed to the SWE community through exploring
        and sharing our prototypes.
